[scanner]
canbus_uuid: 44efb6abf3f9            
#    adjust to suit your scanner, if using usb change to serial.
#    serial: /dev/serial/by-id/usb-cartographer_cartographer_
x_offset: 0                          
#    adjust for your cartographers offset from nozzle to middle of coil
y_offset: 15                         
#    adjust for your cartographers offset from nozzle to middle of coil
backlash_comp: 0.00580
#   Backlash compensation distance for removing Z backlash before measuring
#   the sensor response.
# 
#   Offsets are measured from the centre of your coil, to the tip of your nozzle 
#   on a level axis. It is vital that this is accurate.
